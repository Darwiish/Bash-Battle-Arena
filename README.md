## Game Levels

### Level 1: The Basics
**Mission:**  
- Create a directory named `Arena`.  
- Inside it, create three files: `warrior.txt`, `mage.txt`, `archer.txt`.  
- List the contents of the `Arena` directory.  

---

### Level 2: Variables and Loops
**Mission:**  
- Create a script that outputs numbers 1 to 10, one number per line.  

---

### Level 3: Conditional Statements
**Mission:**  
- Check if a file named `hero.txt` exists in `Arena`.  
- Print `Hero found!` if it exists, otherwise `Hero missing!`.  

---

### Level 4: File Manipulation
**Mission:**  
- Copy all `.txt` files from the `Arena` directory to a new directory called `Backup`.  

---

### Level 5: The Boss Battle - Combining Basics
**Mission:**  
- Create a directory called `Battlefield`.  
- Inside it, create files: `knight.txt`, `sorcerer.txt`, `rogue.txt`.  
- Check if `knight.txt` exists; if it does, move it to a new directory called `Archive`.  
- List contents of both `Battlefield` and `Archive`.  

---

### Level 6: Argument Parsing
**Mission:**  
- Write a script that accepts a filename as an argument and prints the number of lines in that file.  
- If no filename is provided, display `No file provided`.  

---

### Level 7: File Sorting Script
**Mission:**  
- Sort all `.txt` files in a directory by their size (smallest → largest).  
- Display the sorted list.  

---

### Level 8: Multi-File Searcher
**Mission:**  
- Search for a specific word or phrase across all `.log` files in a directory.  
- Output the names of files that contain the word or phrase.  

---

### Level 9: Script to Monitor Directory Changes
**Mission:**  
- Monitor a directory for any changes (file creation, modification, deletion).  
- Log changes with timestamps.  

---

### Level 10: Boss Battle 2 - Intermediate Scripting
**Mission:**  
1. Create a directory called `Arena_Boss`.  
2. Inside it, create `file1.txt` → `file5.txt`.  
3. Generate a random number of lines (10–20) in each file.  
4. Sort files by size and display the list.  
5. Check if any file contains the word `Victory`. If found, move it to `Victory_Archive`.  

> Level 10 combines loops, random number generation, file operations, sorting, and conditional checks.
